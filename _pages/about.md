I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural Science and Engineering at Tennessee State University, based at the Otis L. Floyd Nursery Research Center in McMinnville, Tennessee. My research focuses on advancing agricultural automation and digital technologies to support specialty crop production.

**Research Interests:**

* **Precision and autonomous agricultural machinery** – design and evaluation of intelligent systems to improve efficiency and sustainability.

* **AI, computer vision, and field robotics in agriculture** – developing smart sensing and robotic solutions for crop monitoring and management.

* **Modeling, simulation, and control of agricultural systems** – creating data-driven and physics-based models to optimize resource use and system performance.
