## Bio {#home}

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural Science and Engineering at **Tennessee State University**, based at the **Otis L. Floyd Nursery Research Center** in McMinnville, Tennessee.

My research focuses on **agricultural automation, digital agriculture, and intelligent sensing systems** for specialty crop production. I develop and integrate robotics, computer vision, and IoT technologies to enable **precision, data-driven, and sustainable agricultural management**, with applications in nurseries, orchards, and controlled environments.
